The License Plate have been extracted from Preprocessing Step and then Character segmenation is done using Connected Component Analysis based on the width, height and area we can threshold the values and segment the characters.
Then the segment characters are then passed to the Recognizer for Recognition of Characters using Support Vector Machine(SVM).
